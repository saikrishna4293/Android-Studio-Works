# Android Works

Hi everyone this is Saikrishna <br />
These are my Android Studio works

## What I have done
In which I have developed some basic apps like <br />
You can find some screenshots in jpg file and code in .java file. <br />
	* **[Calculator]**- it includes Add, Sub, Div sections and displays the result, We can do much more. <br />
	* **[Intents]** - It shifts from one page to other (intents) <br />
	* **[Login]** - It checks the database for correct username and password and if attempts fail for 3 times, then we have to restart the app <br />
	* **[TimeSwap]** - When clicked it transfer from Analog to digital and viceversa <br />
	* **[Checkbox]** - here I have designed some options to check, we can choose multiple options, or a single option <br />

### What I want to do
I have many ideas in my mind but time will tell, whether I want to implement or not. let's see. If I have enough time and mood, definitely I will learn and work on it.
```
Thank You for checking out my apps. Have a great day
